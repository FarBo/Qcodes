    "# Deeper dive on qcodes doNd functionalities with a focus on arrayed sweeping benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, we want to show how the qcodes measurement can be simplified with using qcodes doNd functions. Also. we test 2-dimentional sweeping with a naive point by point sweeping over x and y axis and measure z axis values compared to sweeping over x axis and considering y axis as an array of numbers to measure z axis values. The array method can be useful in buffered data acquisitions from instruments that have buffer to write data. Then, the measurement time can be enhanced significantly."
